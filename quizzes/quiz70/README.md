## Code

```.py
import math
ips = []

def ipv4Machine():
    for i in range(1, 255**4+1):
        a = math.floor(i / 255 / 255 / 255 % 255)
        b = math.floor(i / 255 / 255 % 255)
        c = math.floor(i / 255 % 255)
        d = math.floor(i % 255)
        ips.append(f"{a}:{b}:{c}:{d}")

ipv4Machine()
```

While the above code reduced the need of having four for loops, it actually increases the run time as there are 4 calculations needed for every number from 1 to 255 * 4. Having four for loops that just print the indexes results in reduced run time. The generator can use the following code for reduced run time but bad coding practices.

```.py

def ipvyMachineV2():
    for a in range(1,255):
        for b in range(1,255):
            for c in range(1,255):
                for d in range(1,255):
                    ips.append(f"{a}:{b}:{c}:{d}")

```

## Proof

The proof for this quiz is generated by reducing the 0-255 range to 0-4 to reduce run time and produce an output.
